New Site Time! 

My old site is old. O L D. Just as the cobbler's children often have no shoes, UX people often have neglected Web sites, and I am certainly one of those. It was running on Squarespace 6, which - hey - was OK 5 years ago, but even Squarespace has long since moved on to Squarespace 7\. They've also retargeted, it seems, and it really doesn't fit my needs any longer. (I'm still a HUGE advocate for it for many other types of sites, though. HUGE.) ![Screenshot of dgcooley.com as of 02 January 2015. ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/467b47ce-3173-49b3-95aa-1383d174669d.png)

I checked my email history, and it seems I signed up for The Grid on 09 December 2014\. Startups have hiccups, of course, and it's now 02 January, 2016\. So I've spent just over a year explaining that yes, my site is lacking, but I don't want to invest the time to redo it and then have to redo it all over again when I could finally move over to The Grid! I guess I don't have any excuses anymore, so here's hoping this is as amazing and easy as advertised.
